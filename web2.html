				In an impressive sprint at 2015’s end, employers added 292,000 workers to their payrolls in December, the government said on Friday, punctuating a year of healthy growth.

				The unemployment rate stayed at 5 percent last month, the Labor Department said, but that was mostly because large numbers of people went looking for work.

				The department revised its earlier estimate of job creation in October and November, adding 50,000 more jobs to last year’s totals. All in all, the economy added 2.65 million jobs for the year, capping a two-year gain that was the best since the late 1990s.

				The jobless rate, which has declined since topping the 10 percent mark in October 2009, continues to hover just above what economists consider full employment — the point where further declines could start to push up inflation.

				“I think this really is illustrative of the fact that economic momentum in the United States is still awfully strong,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “In spite of the craziness we’ve seen from Asian markets this week, the fundamentals here at home are still solid.”

				Despite the improving job market, sluggish wage growth remains a persistent thorn. Wages remained flat in December.

				Looking ahead, the biggest question is whether overall growth will remain strong enough to keep hiring steady, or whether turmoil in China and elsewhere in the global economy will weigh on the United States economy by holding down exports and further undercutting the struggling manufacturers.

				“We certainly see the impact of global conditions in the manufacturing sector, where the strong dollar and weak commodities prices have diminished momentum substantially,” Mr. Tannenbaum said, “but the service side of the American economy is progressing unabated.”

				Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, acknowledged that “there are a lot of crosscurrents.” Although the auto industry reported record vehicle sales in 2015, he noted, “anything trade-sensitive is getting hammered because of what’s going on overseas.”

				Still, he was enthusiastic about job creation.

				“The remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years,” Mr. Zandi said. “We’re getting at least 200,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis. That’s quite an achievement.”

				The average monthly gain in jobs last year, 221,000, was better than the 2013 average of 199,000, but short of the 260,000 reached in 2014. (Since the figures posted Friday are preliminary, the 2015 average could change.)

				The country’s economic fortunes will figure largely in this year’s presidential campaign. Republican candidates have attacked President Obama and other Democrats’ economic policies, though such criticisms could lose their sting if the employment picture continues to improve.

				Cautious optimism about the labor market contributed to the Federal Reserve’s decision a few weeks ago to raise interest rates from their near-zero levels, where they had rested since 2008. Analysts are now scanning the employment and wage figures for signs of how quickly the Fed will follow up with further rate increases.

				The report announced each month by the Labor Department is by nature a single snapshot and because of the holidays, December is always a bit anomalous.

				Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research, noted that in job postings, there was a dip in December. “That’s something that happens every year as people take vacation,” he said, adding that he expected a reversal in the coming month. “Looking forward, January is the best time to be looking for a job. There’s always a big jump in labor demand in January.”

				Mr. Chamberlain said worker benefits like paid parental leave and free catered lunches had significantly outpaced wage increases over the past decade. But those gains have occurred primarily at the nation’s larger companies (those with more than 500 employees) and among the highest skilled workers or members of unions, which have some bargaining power.

				“That’s definitely part of what we’re seeing here with slow wage growth,” Mr. Chamberlain said.
