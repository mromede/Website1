Git assignment

Part 1
Repository: A repository is a directory where Git will use to "version control" your files.

**To Start/Create a NEW Project/Repository**

1) In your terminal, enter: cd ..
-Do this until you are in the right directory where you want to create your NEW project.

2) Enter: mkdir *ENTER THE NAME YOU WISH HER. NO BLANK SPACES!!*
-This will create/make a brand new, EMPTY directory for you

3) Enter: cd *The directory name you made in step (2)*

4) Enter: git init 
-This completes your creation of a new project. *NOTE: This project/repository only exists on your local machine. It does not exist on you online account.*

Commit: A commit is any change made to the repository and "git commit records this." 

touch+add: Everytime you type in "git add *insert something*", this gets added to a "section" and then, you can successfully commit this section to your repository.
			"touch *enter name*", creates a new file

5) Enter: touch *enter file name*

6) Enter: git add *file name from above*

7) Enter: git commit -m "Enter a name/comment here"
-Now, a commit has been successfully made.
